summary: A sumary of what I'm working on now.

Being ADHD, I my world is littered with many incomplete projects. This is a list of what I'm nominally doing, though some of this may include projects that haven't officially been abandoned yet.

## Neurodiverse outreach

This site was created to share my experience of the world in the hope of making a difference to someone's life, even if it's just to show them that they are not alone. 

### This site

I'm still in the process of setting up this site. It'll take a while, but hopefully there is enough to get started.

### Untitled Autism/ADHD/Neurodiverse podcast

I've recently started floating the idea of doing a podcast on neurodiversity. In May 2023, three members of the neurodiverse community at work ran a discussion where we touched on neurodiverse topics. It was well received by both neurotypical and neurodiverse audience members. The hope is that the podcast will do something similar - letting people realise they aren't alone in their experiences, and trying to build a bridge between the neurpotypical and neurodiverse worlds.

## Digital Accessibility

In April 2021 I started working in the field of digital accessibility. I came to the role with no experience in accessibility, and outdated web experience - the last time I did anything web based CSS was still new and very unreliable, and JavaScript was not a necessity to browse or develop on the web. I've since learnt a lot, but learning is always an ongoing process.

## Geekery

These are some of the things I do for fun...

### A11y Quick Check

A friend developed a Google Chrome extension that assists in finding accessibility issues in web pages. I volunteered to help with the project, and have ported it to FireFox and Safari (macOS and iOS), and worked on modularising the codebase. It's still not officially released yet, but we are getting closer.

### Windows installer

Because I like messing computers to breaking point, I find that I need to re-install them regularly. When Microsoft released [Winget Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/), I realised that I could leverage that to create an installer that would largely configure a new computer from a JSON configuration file.  This was also an excuse to learn PowerShell. You can access my [Windows Installer](https://github.com/MarcusP-P/WindowsInstall) on Github. I tend to get back to this project whenever I need to re-install a Windows laptop. 

### 2023 Advent of Code

I've been participating in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). By that I mean I did the first day and promptly forgot about it. I'll leave this in here on the assumption that I'll get around to doing the rest of it... eventually. My progress is on my [Advent of Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/MarcusP-P/AdventOfCode).

### Live Timing

I follow a certain 24 hour car race. Part of watching an endurance race is keeping track of the gaps between cars, seeing if they are closing over time or not. The official site has had various issues over the years, and struggled to give me the information I'm after, so I started to write my own.

### Bookmark manager

A while ago, my web browser's bookmark syncing went haywire, and duplicated bookmarks. I backed them up, and started working on a tool that allows me to remove duplicates, and re-organise my bookmarks

### Colourblind Simulator

I've been slowly working on a colourblind simulator that can simulate what I see to allow non-colourblind people to get an idea of how I see.

### Programming Concepts website

I've  started working on a site to teach programming concepts to people curious about programming.

## Lego
Currently between builds, hoping to start my Peugeot 9x8 kit soon. I really appreciate the Le Mans 24 Hour kits.
