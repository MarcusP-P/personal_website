summary: A sumary of what I'm working on now.

The biggest thing that I'm working on is developing an understanding of myself from the perspective of my Austism and ADHD diagnosis.

This page is still very much in-progress

## Programming
I'm working on a few projects in various states of completion and attention; Windows installation script again in preparation of re-installing my Windows Laptop; an on again-off again program to display timing information for a certain 24 hour car race in a way that I would find useful; working on a tool to assist accessibility testing web sites; a tool to manage web browser bookmarks; the 2023 Advent of Code (I've done the first day, and promptly forgot about it); and a colourblind simulator to allow me to show to others what I see online.

I've also started workinbg on a site which discusses programming concepts, link coming soon.

## Lego
Currently between builds, hoping to start my Peugeot 9x8 kit soon. I really appreciate the Le Mans 24 Hour kits.

## Blog
