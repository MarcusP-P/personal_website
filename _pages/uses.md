If you're curious, this is my geeky equipment

## Computers

I use two computers day-to-day - a Windows laptop and a Mac Laptop. I can generally geek out on either one. My Windows laptop is also used  for Windows development, and .Net stuff, because Visual Studio 2022 on the Mac is being abandoned. With the addition of [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about), I've been able to do Linux stuff on Windows too.  Any web work is done in Visual Studio code on either computer.

## My Desk

Generally, when I'm doing my personal geeking out, I'm on either of my laptops on the couch in the Lounge room, but when I'm at my desk, I have two 32 inch 4k monitors attached to three docking stations (My Windows Laptop, my Mac Laptop, and my work laptop).

## Development frameworks and environments

the majority of my projects are created using .Net and c#, including Blazor for web pages, and ASP.core. The web extension work is being done on TypeScript and Javascript with HTML. I'm also playing around with PowerShell. If I need to do something quickly, or hacky, I jump into unix Shell programming. This site is created with Jekyll and Markdown.
