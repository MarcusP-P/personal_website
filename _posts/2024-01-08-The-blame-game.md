Before I start, I just want to say that I make blanket statements below. I want to acknowledge up-front that I know that despite how it comes across, I do not think it applies to all interactions between neurotypical people and neurodiverse people, or even most. Of course, given that research has shown that neurotypical people make very quick negative snap judgements about autistics, I can only assume that in our interactions people have not had those thoughts.

I've been dealing with people accusing me of being abrupt, or too direct in my communication styles, or just assigning additional negative meanings, subtexts, or emotions to what I say, despite me not having those thoughts or feelings, even despite me repeatedly insisting that those thoughts or feelings do not exist. These same people tend to also be the ones that get upset with me when I misinterpret what they have to say. Some of this comes from things like not being good at, or seeing the point of small talk, while some of it comes from years of failed communications, and trying to be as explicit as possible implies that we think others are stupid.

But this kind of stuff goes further. Given that my Autism diagnosis was only 3 years ago, and occurred in my 40s, I'm still learning what my needs are, and I share them with people around me. I'm also sharing my state of mind more often. But even these are being interpreted as me making demands that my needs must all be met, to the expense of the needs of others in my life. 

Apart from that misinterpretation, there are also issues with assumptions made:
1. It's just assumed that we just know what the needs of neurotypical people are, despite it being okay for them to not just know our needs.
2. any masking that we do, such as not saying something ,when we really feel it's something important that we think others should know, or suppress strong reactions to something that really affects or bothers us, is never seen nor recognised as us accomodating others' needs, despite the toll that masking takes on my mental health. It's therefore assumed that we are starting from a point of not trying to meet other's needs.

The thing is, we can have long conversations with others on the spectrum, or who have ADHD, and not have the issue of malice being ascribed to my words, despite us communicating in the same way, and saying the same things, and neurotypicals can communicate amongst themselves with less problems. 

Unfortunately, it's easy for both sides of autistic/neurotypical communication to forget that the other side doesn't automatically know the needs of the other participant. It can be especially hard for the neurotypical participant to remember that an autistic person has as much of an understanding of how they work, as they do of an autistic person. Because the neurotypical person live in a world where the majority of their communications are with others whose minds work in a similar way to theirs, day to day, they can automatically assume that the person they're communicating with has an understanding of their needs and interpretations.
