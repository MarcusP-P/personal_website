What better time to talk about positives than when you are suffering the post-COVID-vaccine blues?

I know I've spoken about difficulties in fitting in with the world, but I don't want you to get the impression that being neurodiverse is a curse. Yes, there are downsides, but there are some great positives. I know some people refer to them as superpowers, but I'm not sure how I feel about that, probably because I'm not sure that I give myself credit for those benefits.

One of my skills is working with data, collating it, ensuring it's consistent, identifying holes in the data that we have, and working on changing processes to close those holes. These skills are so second nature to me that that I struggle to accept that this is not a common skill. This was emphasised in a meeting at work[^1], where we were all introducing ourselves, and I mentioned the main part of my work, and someone else added that I also manage data gathering. Until that point, while I thought the task was important, It just hadn't occurred to me that it was special. 

A feature of Autism is the ability to develop special interests, that allow us to really develop in-depth knowledge of a topic. Those that know me will know that one of these interest topics are computers. My [About Me page](/about/) talks about my interests in computers. Because I came from a time when personal computers were less complex, It was easier for me to play around in the lower level of operating systems, a task that's much harder with the abstractions of modern operating systems, such as graphical interface layers, reduced user serviceable components at the lower levels. My interest has given me a great general understanding of how computers work, which has allowed me to quickly grasp concepts, and diagnose problems. 

Of course, the interest in computers spread to programming them. I still enjoy learning new programming languages and concepts, and hobby programming. My [What Iâ€™m working on now](/now/) page contains some of the stuff I'm working on, for various values of currently. Of course the combination of data and programming lends itself to some fun, but scary abuse of Excel formulas.
