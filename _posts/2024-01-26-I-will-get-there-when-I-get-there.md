At work, our team has started a discussion about accomodations for disability. This discussion has me considering the nature of accomodations, and I was reminded of an experience I recently had. Accomodations are was of doing things, or tools that support people with disabilities. People usually think of accomodations in terms of physical disabilities, such as  [captions](https://www.deafnessforum.org.au/what-is-captioning/) to help people with hearing impairments, [ramps](https://www.science.org/content/article/ramps-disabled-people-trace-back-ancient-greece) to assist people with mobility impairments, or [audible pedestrian buttons](https://www.visionaustralia.org/community/news/2023-02-02/history-pb5-crosswalk-button). People with cognitive impairments also require accomodations, and I've been very lucky that I work with an amazing team who have given me accomodations as needed.

Over the last few years since my diagnosis, I've been starting to learn what my needs are, and what accomodations can help me. Not too long ago, I learnt is how even the smallest things can be accomodations for someone.

Recently, I had a first in-person meet up with someone who also has autism, after only having known them from online and video chats. As someone with ADHD, I tend to run chronically late. To avoid inconveniencing others, I use my phone's feature that lets me share my estimated arrival time (ETA) with others. In this case, I knew I had to park a slight distance from the meeting point, so I let them know that it would take me another 10 minutes or so to get to them. Once I had parked, I then asked my phone to let them know the ETA for walking to the meeting point. When I arrived, they told me how helpful it was that I let them know when I was nearby, so they could start looking out for me.

As someone with autism, I struggle with sudden changes. I have an idea of how a given weekend will progress - when I need to get ready, when I need to go out, when I need to do errands, etc. I then plan things I'm going to do around that. When these plans change, I struggle, even suggesting that we go shopping can throw me.

Recently a friend used the ETA feature to let me know that they were on their way to swing by my place. Knowing when they would get here let me know when I had to be ready for them, and allowed me to realise that I had time to finish what I was working on, and then could calmly prepare for their arrival. It was a major change from knowing that someone was due soon, but no idea when "soon" is. Knowing that someone is coming, but not knowing if I have time to do something, or just waiting makes me very uncomfortable. The act of my friend sharing their ETA gave me the ability to know almost exactly when they would arrive, so I wasn't stuck waiting for an indefinite time.

I had never expected a function like sharing my ETA to be an accomodation, yet its use in letting me know when someone is going to arrive, makes a difference that's disproportionate to the simpleness of the feature. When people require accommodations, it may be hard to visualise how much of a difference something small can make, so, when people ask for accommodations, please listen - you may not understand why, or how important is it, but it will make someone else's life easier. This is a lesson I'm still learning, from both sides. We will all make mistakes. The important thing is to learn from them.
