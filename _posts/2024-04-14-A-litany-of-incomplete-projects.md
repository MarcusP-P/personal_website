One of the characteristics of ADHD is that people who have ADHD have [lower levels of dopamine](https://psychcentral.com/adhd/what-to-know-about-adhd-and-dopamine). As a result, we don't get a dopamine hit for completing a task. One of the ways this has shown up in my life is leaving things to the last minute. I don't get the good feeling of completing something, but I do get the adrenaline rush when I have a big task to complete in a short amount of time. It appears that I have managed to train my brain to seek that adrenaline rush by leaving things to the last minute, to the degree that I can find it almost impossible to start tasks early.

The ability to hyperfocus means that I can do some amazing work in a short amount of time. During my university honours course, one of my fellow students told me that he was amazed that I could start a programming assignment the midnight before it was due, and come up with a good solution that while not perfect, correctly solves the problem.

Another ADHD symptom of low dopamine is [novelty-seeking](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-01194-6). Getting a high by finding something new to do. My life is littered with incomplete personal projects, especially programming/it related projects. Once I have solved the major problem, or learnt a new technology or technique, the novelty and therefore the motivation to complete the project disappears, and I'm looking for a new project.

A good example is the neglect of this blog since late January. I've managed to get a blog and website setup, I've added a few posts, I've customised the theme. The novelty is gone, I've learnt the new stuff - the remaining work is just more of the same, so while I've had a few ideas for posts, I just haven't been able to motivate myself to write them.

Basically this post is an apology for not posting more on here. I'd like to be able to promise that I will write more often, but I can't. I'll write to you next time I write to you.
