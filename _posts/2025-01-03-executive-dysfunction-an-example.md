[Executive functions][1] are the "set of cognitive processes that support goal-directed behaviour". One of the symptoms of both ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is [executive dysfunction][2], which is an impairment of your executive functioning, which disrupts planning and goal setting behaviours. Executive dysfunction is believed to be the underlying issue that leads to [ADHD paralysis][3], which is where "simple tasks" can be seen as disproportionately massive tasks, and impossible to start.

Others have commented on my ability to get stuck in the weeds, which is an example of executive dysfunction not allowing me to follow a simple path, without going into too much depth. I've tried in the past to explain why some tasks, that others consider simple and quick, seem insurmountable, but I don't think I've ever been able to explain it clearly enough to understand. Today I experienced an example, and had the presence of mind to document the process, and demonstrate how executive dysfunction can disrupt what could bee seen as a relatively simple task.

Today the expected high will be 31°C, and in the next two days will be 36°C and 38°C, which will allow the carpets to dry quickly. At 11 AM, when I started the process, the temperature was 18°C, where I could wash the floors while it was cool, and then let the heat dry them out.

Before I describe how I would approach this task, I'd like the reader to just plan this task out, and see how many steps it takes, and at the end compare it to the steps my brain sees are needed to perform the task:

- Empty the car of all items
- If I dust after using the wet vac, dust will fall on the washed carpets
  - Start from top down clean non fabric surfaces before using the wet vac
  - I need clean microfibre towels to clean these surfaces, but the microfibre towels are all dirty
    - Wash Microfibre towels
      - Empty the clothes dryer
      - Transfer washing from washing machine to dryer and start dryer
      - Collect all microfibre cloths
      - Ensure I include my microfibre glasses cleaning cloths, because some are have absorbed enough dirt that using them only smears the glasses
        - Notice some of my glasses are filthy (In other words, there is the merest hint of a smudge). If I clean them using freshly washed cleaned glasses cloths, then the clean glasses cloths will be dirty again.
          - Go through all my glasses, and seperate the current and previous prescription ones (in a rare nod to efficiency, I decide to limit this to my current and previous sets of glasses - I can still use an additional two sets of glasses beyond these, that I decided not to clean)
            - Clean each pair of glasses
              - Using any cleaning cloths that don't smear dirt, clean the glasses as well as possible
              - hold glasses to light to look extremely carefully for any hint of a smear or smudge (I was looking closely enough that I noticed some almost imperceptible manufacturer's markings on the lenses that I had not previously noticed over the last several years of owning them)
              - use combination of glasses cleaning spray, and cleaning cloths until no hint of a smudge appears
          - Clean all glasses thoroughly, using last of the cleaning cloths that aren't spreading grease, and the glasses cleaning spray
          - Collect all current and previous prescription glasses, and clean them until there is no hint of a smudge
      - Notice I have one clean microfibre towel, and remember that my laptop has a grease mark on the outside case
        - Clean outer surface of laptop with towel
        - Notice dust on the screen
          - Clean the keyboard and screen of laptop
        - iPad case has fingerprint
          - Move iPad to other case
          - Clean iPad case inside and out
          - Remember other iPad case isn't clean either
          - Move iPad to newly cleaned case
            - The back of the iPad isn't clean, so it will dirty the inside of newly cleaned case
            - Clean back of iPad where it will magnet to clean case so clean case does not get dirty
              - There is no point in cleaning just part of the iPad - I need to clean its front too
                - Find special iPad screen [polishing cloth][4]
                - Clean iPad screen
- Remove car mats and wet vac them
  - I want to use the sanitising cleaning liquid, rather than the pet odour one, because I'm not worried about pet odours in the car, but I've never used this liquid before
    - Find the manual for the wet vac
    - Read up the instructions on using the sanitising liquid
    - Re-assemble the parts of the wet vac that have been drying since its last use
    - Fill the water tank with water and sanitising solution
      - Find the sanitising solution
      - Check if the sanitising solution has Scotchguard, or if I need to use the additive
        - Read the instructions on how to sue the additive
- Wet vac the car's carpet
- Clean the wet vac
  - Clean the wet vac hose until no dirt comes out of it
  - Use any remaining cleaning solution in the washer, because the next use will probably be to clean up after pets, which is a different solution, and you shouldn't mix different cleaning products
  - Clean the hose again using plain water, as it may have been dirtied by the additional clean
  - Rinse out the solution container until it no longer foams
  - Clean the dirty water container
    - Dissasemble the dirty water container
    - Clean each part of the container
  - Let the parts dry

After about 2 hours, I now have the towels and cloths in the wash. The wash is a heavy duty cycle, with extra rinses to ensure that there is no trace of the detergent left on the towels and cloths. This cycle lasts 3 hours and 24 minutes, and that excludes the time in the dryer. The temperature is now 27°C outside, which is bordering on too hot to do any physical work.

Not all of these tasks were in the initial planning - it wasn't until I was collecting the glasses cleaning rags that I noticed that some previous pairs of glasses were dirty too, so that got added, and I'm sure that while I'm looking and reading the manual for the wet vac, I'll either find something that needs cleaning or sorting, or something that I wasn't aware of in the use of the wet vac.

It also hasn't occurred to me until writing this that while I'm waiting the towels to wash, I can clean items out of my car, find the manual for the wet vac, and wash the floors while mats.

Also, notice that there is no re-assembly of the wet vac after the parts are all dry. It will take the best part of a day for these to dry, and they will be placed out of the way as they dry. With the [ADHD lack of object permanence][5], I will forget that the wet vac needs to be put back together, and will only remember when I'm in the area where it's out of the way, but the only reason I would be there is to do something else, that I could forget about if I stopped to re-assemble the wet vac.

A lot of well-meaning people come up with suggestions that [boil down to][6] "Oh, why don;t you just use [this executive dysfunction] to overcome your executive dysfunction." This type of response shows that the person giving the advice has not understood the concept of executive dysfunction in the first place. There are [ways of improving][2] executive dysfunction, but they are not simple fixes.

I just want to leave you with one of the most entertaining descriptions of executive dysfunction that I've come across in a [tumblr post by chaotic-neutral-knitter][7]:

> I do love the phrase executive dysfunction bc the image it conjures is of a bunch of people wearing business suits around a long oval conference table arguing with each other to the point where they’re getting into physical fights, but in the background there’s just a big empty whiteboard with a To Do list with one item on it and that item is “take shower”
