This weekend was the [24 Hours of Le Mans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Hours_of_Le_Mans) motor race. For the past decade, I've tried to stay up to watch the full race live, including the practice and qualifying sessions. Living in Australia, the practice and qualifying sessions run from about 10 PM to 7 AM on Wednesday and Thursday night, with the race running 24 continuous hours from midnight on Saturday evening. Do I go full ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) for Le Mans? Your bet your arse I do.

This year's race was an exciting and unpredictable race, with differing strategies playing out over the 24 hours giving teams that couldn't compete on speed a chance to win. The circuit is 13.6257 km long, which is considered long for most motor racing circuits. The length of track allows teams to use differing strategies - teams can choose to drive faster, meaning they use more petrol, and need to stop in the pits more often, or they can run slower, stay out on the track for longer, and require fewer pit stops. Changing tyres, and when to change a car's drivers also allow for flexibility in strategy; if a team chooses to change tyres, they must wait until they have finished fuelling the car first, before they can start, which adds to the length of a pit stop, but fresh tyres allow the car to drive faster, while tyres that have been on the car for a while can slow the car. Teams are also limited in how many tyres they can use in a race. The fastest car does not always win, and a slower car can win by employing clever strategies, and making the right decisions at the right time. Of course, different cars have different strengths. Some work better in the colder hours of the night, while others are faster in warmer conditions.

On paper the Ferrari team should have won easily, and Porsche, who have been slower all year, including at Le Mans shouldn't have been able to finish in the top 5, but at the end of 14 hours, the winner finished only 14 seconds ahead of second place, showing that the Porsche strategy kept them competitive.

To understand the state of a race, you need to keep an eye on how long it takes the cars to go around the track, the length of their pit stops, the gaps between the different cars, when they last stopped, when they last changed tyres and drivers. If this starts to sound like an ASD data geek's dream, you can start to see why longer endurance races like Le Mans appeal to me, and why I look forward to it every year, and like any obsession an Autistic person has, I go all in.

I start with my viewing setup. As usual, the lounge TV has the main video feed and commentary. On a couple of small portable tables in front of me are an old 15" laptop that displays [live timing data](https://fiawec.tv/). Of course, I'm not happy with the standard format, so I use the [Timing 71](https://www.timing71.org) browser extension to format the timing in an easier to use. On the left of that, I have two phones and an iPad that show the streams of various in-car cameras. Later on in the race, I started switching these between cars that were having battles on track, and next year I'll switch the cars I'm following more often. I used a second laptop to look at more detailed timing analysis, track [race stewards’ decisions](https://fiawec.alkamelsystems.com/noticeBoard.php), social media, and web browsing.

To make it easier to identify similar looking cars, the organisers have released their [official spotter’s guide](https://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/check-out-the-2025-24-hours-of-le-mans-spotter-guide-59672), but third parties have released an [Unofficial spotter’s guide](https://spotters.guide). Initially I printed these out on A4 paper. I also printed out the [track map](https://fiawec.alkamelsystems.com/Results/14_2025/04_LE%20MANS/00_Event%20Info/Circuit%20Map.pdf) and [entry list](https://fiawec.alkamelsystems.com/Results/14_2025/04_LE%20MANS/00_Event%20Info/24h%20Provisional%20Entry%20List%20v6.pdf). During the first few practice sessions, I found that the paper wasn't stiff enough, so I laminated them. I also realised that most of the sheets were too small to read some of the small text, so I re-printed them at A3 (and laminated them of course). 

In previous years, there was a mess of cables running between the couch and the tables. This year, having been inspired by some previous cable tidying, I placed a multi-port USB C charger on the table, which allowed me to run one power backer to the table. Of course, that meant that the laptop I was using didn't have power. The solution there was to run one USB cable back to the couch, and use Velcro to keep it attached to the main power cable. I also used Velcro to tidy up the cables on the table. It was the first time that I was happy, and even proud, with the cable situation.

There is an Anker USB C charging brick, and from there cables run to one of the phones, the iPad, the laptop, with a fourth cable running back along the main power lead. The cables are all tidily velcroed.](/assets/LeMansCables.jpg)

Normally while watching Le Mans, I've had a laptop on my lap, and was geeking out on it while watching the race. This year, however, was different. Earlier in the year, I had switched from Vyvanse to short acting Ritalin, which has made a massive difference in my ability to focus and pay attention. In hindsight, I noticed that I spent much less time playing on the laptop, mainly using it to gather more information on the race, and much more attention was spent on the race. It was the first time in a long time that I was able to stay awake for the whole race without needing a nap. Previously, I've needed to nap for anywhere from 20 minutes to about an hour and a half. It's been a long time since I've been able to stay awake the whole time.
